# vog - value object generator

vog provides an easy way to generate different kinds of type-safe value objects in php 

## Installation

vog can be most easily installed with composer:
`composer require marvinwank/vog`

## Usage

After installing with composer, there is a plain php file in `vendor/marvinwank/vog`
It can be called from the CLI and accepts two arguments:

1. [**required**] The path to the directory, in which the value file is located
2. [**optional**] The name of the value file. Default: `value.json`

Example call: `./vendor/marvinwank/vog/vog.php ./app/value`
Example call with custom value file name: `./vendor/marvinwank/vog/vog.php ./app/value  customNameValueFile.json`

Notice the space between between the first an the second argument. 

## The value file

The raw data of the objects to be generated by vog a stored in the value file in json format. 
On the root level of the value file, you have to provide the full path to your projects root with the key `root_path`.
No `/` is necessary at the end

Example:
```json
{
  "root_path": "/home/example_user/example_project/src",
 
 
  "models/values": [
      {
        "type": "enum",
        "name": "DietStyle",
        "values": {
          "EVERYTHING": "everything",
          "VEGETARIAN": "vegetarian",
          "VEGAN": "vegan"
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

As you can already see in the example, the value file also has an array at the top level, with the key of it being a path. 
In this array, an Enum with the name of "DietStyle" is given. When generated, its full path will be 
`root_path` + `<key of the path array>` + `name` + `.php`, so in this example

`/home/example_user/example_project/src/models/values/DietStyle.php`

Its namespace will be automatically generated from the path specification according to PSR-4, so in this case it would be 
`Models\Values` 

Any number of objects may be defined in each path array and any number of path arrays may be given in the value file

*Note:* There can be multiple value files although this is not recommended, because you can define namespaces in the value
file and multiple value files require multiple calls.
