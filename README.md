# vog - value object generator

vog provides an easy way to generate different kinds of type-safe value objects in php 

## Installation

vog can be most easily installed with composer:
`composer require marvinwank/vog`

## Usage

After installing with composer, there is a plain php file in `vendor/marvinwank/vog`
It can be called from the CLI and accepts two arguments:

1. [**required**] The path to the directory, in which the value file is located
2. [**optional**] The name of the value file. Default: `value.json`

Example call: `./vendor/marvinwank/vog/vog.php ./app/value`

## the value file

The raw data of the objects to be generated by vog a stored in the value file in json format. 
On the root level of the json object, at least two attributes have to be defined:

- `root_path` containing a string of the absolute path to the projects root directory
- 

*Note:* There can be multiple value files although this is not recommended, because you can define namespaces in the value
file and multiple value files require multiple calls.
